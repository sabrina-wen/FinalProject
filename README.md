WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Editor
DESCRIPTION

We create an RTF text editor, where you can edit a document and then convert it into HTML.

 List of Working features / Things I should test
- Bold, underline, italicize text. You can also unbold/un-underline/unitalicize text by clicking on the respective button again!
- Change size.
- Change color.
- Change alignment in RTF editor.
- Cut, copy, paste text.
- Converting formatted text/unformatted text into HTML!

List of unresolved bugs :,(
- Does not detect new lines in RTF editor portion.
- Alignment does not convert into HTML
- You can only save one file at a time. So you can save the file as many times as you want, but each you save, you will lose the previous versions of your file.

Directions on how to compile and run your code
- javac WYSIWYG.java
- java WYSIWYG

Directions on how to use your program
- Use buttons/menus on GUI to interact and format text, and to convert it.
- Your converted text to HTML file will save in whatever folder you are running WYSIWYG.java in. So if you are running it in our repo, the file way be saved there if you want to access the .html file.
